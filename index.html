<b>Data Preprocessing</b>
<blockquote>

First read the training dataset from CSV format by:
<br> > training<-read.csv("pml-training.csv")
<br><br>
There are attributes (the first 7) which are not relevant for prediction, live them out
<br> > head(names(training),7)
<br> [1] "X"             "user_name"            "raw_timestamp_part_1" "raw_timestamp_part_2"
<br> [5] "cvtd_timestamp"       "new_window"           "num_window"  
<br> > tr <- training[,8:159]
<br><br>
All the remaing attributes are the recorded signals coming from the sensors and their statistics, values has to be numeric, conversion needed
<br> > types <- sapply(tr,class)
<br> > f<-function(x) {x<-as.numeric(x)}
<br> > tr[,which(types != "numeric")]<-sapply(tr[,which(types != "numeric")],f)
<br><br>
Attributes with count of is.na greater than 70% of the cases has not too much information value, they are deleted from training sample
<br> > f<-function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) > length(x) *0.7}
<br> > leaveout <- sapply(tr,f)
<br> > tr <- tr[,-which(leaveout == T)]
<br><br>
Finally the "classe" output attribute is binded and training dataset is split to train and to test (70% - 30%), to have a good idea about out of sample error	
<br> > set.seed(1)
<br> > ftr <- cbind(tr,training$classe)
<br> > names(ftr)[86] <- "classe"
<br> > tr_ind<-createDataPartition(ftr$classe,p=0.7,list=F)
<br> > ftr_tr <- ftr[tr_ind,]
<br> > ftr_te <- ftr[-tr_ind,]
</blockquote>

<b>Model Training</b>
<blockquote>
Based on the assumption that sensors' signals are independent Naive Bayes classification model could be effective and therefore selected for analysis.
<br>Set up trainControl with crossvalidation default 10 folds and classProbs for having the class probailities on the output
<br> > ctrl <- trainControl(method="cv",number=10,returnData = F,returnResamp = "all", classProbs = T) 
<br> > set.seed(1)
<br> > library(klaR)
<br> > mod <- train(classe ~ ., data = ftr_tr, method = "nb", trControl = ctrl)
<br><br> Have a look how the model looks like, all predictor attribute densisities could be viewed with the plot function,  E.g. for magnet_arm_x attribute look at the image. 
<br> > plot(mod$finalModel)
<br><br> <img src="plot1.png">
<br><br> Get predicting results on the testing dataset by the confusionMatrix function, accuracy looks good: 0.73, not too far from the <a href="http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises">publicated results on HAR homepage</a>
<br> > fte_te_resp <- predict(mod,newdata=ftr_te)
<br> > confusionMatrix(ftr_te_resp,ftr_te$classe)
<br><br> <img src="plot2.png">
</blockquote>

<b>Model Testing</b>
<blockquote>
For model testing the provided test dataset (20 test cases) has to be read and transformed the same way as for training data:
<br> > testing<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
<br><br> Have only the relevant attributes
<br> > te <- testing[,8:159]
<br><br> Convert non-numeric attributes to numeric
<br> > types <- sapply(te,class)
<br> > f<-function(x) {x<-as.numeric(x)}
<br> > te[,which(types != "numeric")]<-sapply(te[,which(types != "numeric")],f)
<br><br> Predict test cases with type="prob" option to have and understanding on the probability for each output classes
<br> > te_resp <- predict(mod,newdata=te,type="prob")
